# Command--line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM :
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED : 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM : 
## Step 1:
Import sys module to use command line arguments.

## Step 2:
Create a file pointer and open the file which is passed in command line.

## Step 3:
Initialize word count as zero.

## Step 4:
For each line in file, split it into words and find number of the words in every line.

## Step 5:
Sum the number of words in each line.

## Step 6:
Display the total words in the file.

## Step 7:
Close the file pointer and end the program
## PROGRAM :
```
import sys
fp=open(sys.argv[1])
wordcount=0
for i in fp:
    words=i.split()
    wordcount+=len(words)
print("Total no of words in file is",wordcount)
fp.close()
```
### OUTPUT :

![image](https://github.com/23000966/Command--line-arguments-to-count-word/assets/153983364/6b1e150c-6df4-41ae-8b72-154b829843ae)


## RESULT :
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
